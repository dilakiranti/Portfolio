<div style="text-align: justify">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. </div>

**Exponential Smoothing:** 
<div style="text-align: justify"> Exponential Smoothing is a time series method for forecasting univariate time series data. Time series methods work on the principle that a prediction is a weighted linear sum of past observations or lags. The Exponential Smoothing time series method works by assigning exponentially decreasing weights for past observations. It is called so because the weight assigned to each demand observation is exponentially decreased. These GUI tools can be helpful for exploring your data and understanding the results of Exponential Smoothing.</div>
